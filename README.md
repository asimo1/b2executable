# B2Executable

A simple batch(.bat) file to executable(.exe) converter made by me (ASiiMO)

How to install:
- Download 'B2Executable.zip' **(In the releases tab)**
- Extract to a folder
- Run B2Executable.exe


I am using Fatih Kodak's bat to exe converter's command line tools for this project,
I did not change Fatih Kodak's software, i only built on top of it,
So big thanks to him ([Link to his website](http://www.f2ko.de/en/b2e.php))
