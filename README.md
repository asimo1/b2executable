# B2Executable

A simple batch(.bat) file to executable(.exe) converter made by me (ASiiMO)

How to install:
- Download the rar ([Download link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rws8mins9vfw1k0/B2Executable.rar?dl=1))
- Extract to a folder
- Run B2Executable.exe

I did not change Fatih Kodak's software, i only built on top of it.
I am using Fatih Kodak's bat to exe converter's command line tools for this project.
So big thanks to him:
